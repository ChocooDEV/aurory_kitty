## Configuration

### Setting up your OpenAI API Key

This project requires an OpenAI API key to function properly. Follow these steps to set it up:

1. If you don't have an OpenAI API key, sign up at [OpenAI's website](https://platform.openai.com/signup) and create one
2. Create a `.env` file in the root directory of the project
3. Add your API key to the `.env` file in this format:
   ```
   OPENAI_API_KEY='your_api_key_here'
   ```
   Replace `your_api_key_here` with your actual OpenAI API key

**Important**: Never commit your `.env` file to version control. Make sure it's included in your `.gitignore` file.

## Usage

Simply run `npm run dev` and start to chat with Kitty

## Features

Chat with an AI which acts as Kitty, a female AI character.

Every contribution to make the model better are very welcomed!
